# offline-eth-wallet
### A super simple python script to generate a key and mnemonic, along with a corresponding address for an Ethereum paper wallet.

*NOTE*: I have no idea what I'm doing. Use this at your own risk. I'm not responsible for lost money.

Install with poetry -- run `python3 generate_wallet.py` to generate your wallet. This will print details to the terminal, as well as save details in a txt file called `paper_wallet.txt`. You should probably copy these values somewhere secure and delete this file.
